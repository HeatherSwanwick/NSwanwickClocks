        My name is Nigel Swanwick and I am a horologist based in Dublin. 
		The main work that I do is restoration and servicing of antique clocks,
		but I am also a collector myself. If you are interested in getting your
		clock serviced or repaired or if you simply want to enquire about what I
		do, please get in contact through my Contact Me page or find me on my social
		media accounts linked at the bottom of the page.

		Nigel lovingly repaired a clock that has been in my family for
		over 70 years, I was amazed with how well the woodwork came up
		and it is now keeping perfect time.

		<br>
		My grandmother’s clock was in pieces after falling off a shelf and I
		was amazed at the quality of the restoration Nigel did on it. 
		Thank you so much!

		R.S <br>
		<br>
		I bought a beautiful clock in an auction which 
		was unfortunately not running correctly.
		After bringing it to Nigel it’s in full working order.

		J.K <br>

		I bought a clock from Nigel’s collection for my mother and she loves it. 
		Nigel was so helpful and knowledgeable.

		Thanks!
